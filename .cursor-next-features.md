I want you to continue iterate until you fixed and made all of this changes : 

- I was thinking you fixed this "Auto-rebalancing disabled. Use the dashboard to manually allocate capital.", now I should choise myself if I want or not

- I want the "Portfolio balance" and "portfolio rebalancing" process to be applied only for my SPOT portfolio
- I want my trades to be only on Future portfolio, on Futur market, from Future USDT to Future Crypto
- You fixed the 10% risk arbitrary, I want 10% risk when "Moderate strategy", 20% risk when "Intense Strategy", 50% risk when "Risky strategy".
- Make my bot be configured by the dashboard and the user choices
